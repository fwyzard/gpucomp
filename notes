x report (get approved by andrea)
    x full compressor consist of multiple basic algos
    x xz are utilites that use lzma
    x basic algos to list (or skip)
    x cpu compressors to list
    x gpu: these are some of what i found when looking for stuff
    x table to one page
x poster
- lzbench
    x make the master branch compile
    - compile everythig with the same flags (pr when done)
        x bsc
        - dietgpu
        x libnxz
    - culzss

bsc:
- -b1 -m6 -cf -e0 -H15 -M4 -G
- -b1 -m3 -cf -e0 -H10 -M4
   ?       ?  <-- how to change these in lzbench?

   |      this is fine as is
   this one is fine-ish
- H28 is very slow, never use it
- option test says that on gpu it's slower
- small block size (-b1 = 1 MB) speeds it up on small file (5 MB) when multithreaded, as block are processed in parallel
  - not a reasonable comparison when running cpu only as other compressors are run single-threaded
  - doesn't really improve gpu runs
note: -T includes -t
- wait for big file test to finish
