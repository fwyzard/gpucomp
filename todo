little time, need to prioritize:
- benchmark on separated pp event files (p9)
x slides
~ report
- poster
- lzbench

lzbench: build all the things with the same flags (pr when done)
x bsc
- dietgpu
x libnxz

general:
- try dietgpu on multiple files in parallel?
- benchmark on a larger set of files?

report:
? nvcomp binaries not for p9
  - maybe check nvidia download site?
  - maybe don't care, it's proprietary anyway?
? explain dictionary matching and entropy coding
? explain lz variants
? run crude on same data

bsc:
- -b1 -m6 -cf -e0 -H15 -M4 -G
- -b1 -m3 -cf -e0 -H10 -M4
   ?       ?  <-- how to change these in lzbench?

   |      this is fine as is
   this one is fine-ish
- H28 is very slow, never use it
- option test says that on gpu it's slower
- small block size (-b1 = 1 MB) speeds it up on small file (5 MB) when multithreaded, as block are processed in parallel
  - not a reasonable comparison when running cpu only as other compressors are run single-threaded
  - doesn't really improve gpu runs
note: -T includes -t
- wait for big file test to finish
